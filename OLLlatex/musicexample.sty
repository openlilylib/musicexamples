% Lowlevel printing commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The following commands are used to print music examples
% without keeping track of them or numbering them.
% While it is perfectly possible to directly include image files
% instead, it is advisable to use them as a consistent interface

% \musicSFE
%
% SingleFileExample (generic file)
% Print a music example consisting of a single file
% (typically one system, but can also be used
%  for an arbitrary image file).
% Places the image in a separate paragraph
% and suppresses indentation.
% If the image is wider than \texwidth, 
% it is scaled to fit he text column.
%TODO implement the optional downscaling to \textwidth
%     (should also issue a warning)
\newcommand{\musicSFE}[1]{

	\noindent
	\includegraphics{#1}

}

% \lilypondSFE
%
% SingleFileExample (Lilypond file)
% Use this for Lilypond examples that consist of single files.
% While the command actually treats them as ordinary images
% one can use this for a script to keep track
% of changed sources that should be recompiled.
\newcommand{\lilypondSFE}[1]{
	\musicSFE{#1}
}

% \lilypondMFE
%
% MultiFileExample (generic file)
% Use this for music examples consisting of multiple files
% (typically one file for each system)
% Provide the basename (including relative path)
% as the mandatory argument.
% The command will then iterate over the found subfiles 
% (as determined by LilyPond's system-count file)
% and include them as \musicSystem-s
%
\newcounter{lilySysCnt}
\newread\readLilySysCnt

\newcommand{\lilypondMFE}[2][-##]{
	%TODO set this to a file with the actual basefile name
	\openin\readLilySysCnt=cnt.cnt
	% read in the number of systems
	\read \readLilySysCnt to \lilySysCnt

% A) Non-fullpage example environments

%TODO Include the following example types in the \listof{musicExample}
%     (at least write a line to the aux file)

% musicExample
%
% Float type for placing music examples
% Place one or more of the above lowlevel 
% commands inside the environment
% and provide a \caption and \label inside
%
%TODO adjust layout according to the non float versions.

% musicExampleNonFloat
%
% Non float version of a music example
% While one can also use musicexample with the [H] option to 
% place it HERE, this non-floating environment is
% necessary to use multiline examples that may span
% line break(s).
% Place one or more of the above lowlevel 
% commands inside the environment
% and provide a \label.
% As it isn't a float environment,
% you have to provide the caption as a mandatory argument #1

% B) Full-page example environments

%TODO How to realize a page range for multipage examples?

% With full-page examples the numbering and caption is realized
% using the header/footer of the first (or only) page
% (by use of scrpage2 from KOMA-Script).
% The following predefined pagestyle places the caption
% in the inner/left part of the header and 
% the page number centered in the footer.
% To change this to your needs, you only have to 
% redefine the xmpPageOne style afterwards
% (see the KOMA-Script documentation)

	{\upshape\textsf{Example \arabic{musicExample}:}\xmpCaption}{}{}%

% \fullPageMusicExample
%
% (Not intended for use by document authors)
% Base command placing the music example at the beginning
% of the 'next' page (using afterpage)
% and placing the label there.
% #1 - the label for the caption
% #2 - command(s) to be put after the pagebreak
% (usually this is used by one of the following commands)

% \onePageMusicExample
%
% Includes one single page pdf file as a music example.
% Tha document author is responsible to provide files with suitable page margins
% The caption is printed in the header or footer of the page
% using the scrheadings mechanism
%TODO Is it possible to determine the number of pages in the pdf document?
%      If so, could one remove the two separate commands
%      and use only the above \fullPageMusicExample?
%TODO Is it possible to provide 'cropped' image files
%      and scale them suitably to the text area?
%      This would be highly useful regarding two-sided layout
%      (when you don't know whether the example will start left or right)

% Include the lilyglyphs package to allow notational elements 
% in continuous text.
% NOTE: This implies the inclusion of the fontspec package
% which in turn requires the files to be compiled with
% XeLaTeX (or possibly LuaLaTeX)

% NOTE: As I experienced a strange bug (presumably after
% an update of my LaTeX distribution (as a result of an Ubuntu 
% version upgrade)) I comment this out for now.
% But it is intended to be included again, so the above note
% about fontspec and XeLaTeX should be taken seriously
%\RequirePackage{lilyglyphs}

% As long as lilyglyps isn't used we use utf encoding,
% but we can remove this once we have established lilyglyphs
\RequirePackage[utf8]{inputenc}


% Options for use of hyperlinks
% (make sure this is included last)

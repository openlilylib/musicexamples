musicexamples documentation
===========================

If you want to compile this documentation yourself, you will have to 

- get and install the "lilyglyphs" package either from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/lilyglyphs), [Github](https://github.com/uliska/lilyglyphs) or as part of a LaTeX package (TeXLive includes it, for example)
- make sure the included packages are available - when I wrote the manual I was quite generous with that ...

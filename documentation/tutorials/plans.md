documentation/tutorials/plans.md
--------------------------------

This document serves as a place to collect ideas about tutorials that could be added to complement the existing documentation.

A) Proposed
-----------
- Creation of Orchestral Scores  
  Promised by Antonio Gervasoni
- Managing complexity and Tweaking typography (title to be changed)  
  Published by Urs Liska, promised to be converted to OLL

B) Ideas
--------
- Complex transpositions / modular set-ups *(Urs Liska)*  
  'Best practice' how to deal with transposition of works 
  that require partially exchanging enharmonically.  
  It is natural to combine this with a tutorial on modular
  design of score files.
- Reusing music variables and score blocks *(Urs Liska)*  
  This concept is part of the existing OLLincludes
  but should be described in a standalone tutorial
  (with the respective part of the documentation referring
  to the tutorial)

C) Wishes
---------
- Use of Git for working with LilyPond scores (suggested by Urs Liska)  
  Not a tutorial on how to use Git (is out of scope),
  but rather a demonstration of the key features that can make your
  life as a LilyPond developer so much better ;-)

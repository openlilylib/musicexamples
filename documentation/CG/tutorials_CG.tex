\chapter{Documentation}
\todo{Explain the layout of the directory structure. \\
Explain the subfiles approach.\\
Explain the use of sectioning levels.}

\chapter{Command Reference}

This is the reference on specific commands that have been implemented for openLilyLib.
It has to be written from scratch, but I want to at least enumerate all commands as soon as I implement them

\section{Formatting}
Point out that one should \emph{never} apply manual formattings but always semantic style sheets.
If there is none then an author should define one or ask for new ones.

\subsection{Paragraph Formatting}
\begin{description}
\item[\cmd{originalAuthor}] Although it's a collaborative effort, we want to attribute the original author of tutorials or noteable chunks of documentation. Place this command between the \cmd{chapter} heading and an \{abstract\} environment
\end{description}

\subsection{Character Formatting}

\begin{description}
\item[\cmd{cmd}] Commands that start with a backslash can be printed using this command. It switches the font and prints the backslash in front of the command name.
\item[\cmd{todo}] Any TODO item should be entered in the source using this command, because it will guarantee a consistent appearance and it's quite spottable \dots
\end{description}

\subsection{environments}
\begin{description}
\item[abstract] As the “book” documentclasses don't provide \{abstract\} environments, we have our own. Any tutorial should be preceded by an abstract.
\end{description}

% This is a sample tutorial subfile that is intended to be used
% as a model for your own tutorial source files.
% You may use it as a template by making a copy and removing unnecessary
% contents and comments. Or you may just read the comments and the text
% in order to understand how you should set up your files.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The optional argument to the \documentclass should point to
% 'LilyPond-Tutorials.
% As you should place your tutorial in a subfolder of documentation/tutorials
% you will probably just keep the following line as it is:
\documentclass[../LilyPond-Tutorials]{subfiles}

\begin{document}

% A tutorial will become a \chapter in the context of the 
% tutorials compilation. So you should use this sectioning level
% exactly once - instead of a \title
\chapter{A Commented Sample Tutorial}

% Your tutorial should contain an abstract
\begin{authorAbstract}[ %
	\contributor{Optionally},
	\contributor{mention},
	\contributor{contributors}]{Your name}
This is a stub of a tutorial that is used to introduce people who are interested in sharing a tutorial to how they should set up their document.
Please also read the richly commented source file.

To be done: Show examples of any spedific functionality we might implement (LilyPond snippets, code listings etc.)
\end{authorAbstract}
